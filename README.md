Phase 1 Group project : A Meme Generator

Project requirements:

Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.
Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.
Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).
Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.
Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
